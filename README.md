# Getting Started Backend Sample 
This sample shows how to validate tokens in a backend service.

> There's a newer version of this sample! Check it out: https://github.com/azure-samples/ms-identity-dotnet-desktop-aspnetcore-webapi
>
> This newer sample takes advantage of the Microsoft identity platform (formerly Azure AD v2.0).
>
> While still in public preview, every component is supported in production environments.

For step by step instructions, see the [Microsoft Identity Portal](https://identity.microsoft.com/Docs/BackendService).

## About the Basic Backend Service 
This sample backend service is an ASP.NET Core web API. .NET Core ships with a library for performing JSON Web Token (JWT) Bearer Authentication. Here are some key highlights from the code:

1.  This code in startup.cs configures JWT Bearer Authentication for all routes:
   ```
var tokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters();

// If you wish to restrict access to specific organizations, you must configure a list of valid issuers
tokenValidationParameters.ValidateIssuer = false;

var options = new JwtBearerOptions 
{ 
    Audience = Configuration["MicrosoftIdentity:ClientId"], 
    Authority = Configuration["MicrosoftIdentity:Authority"],
    TokenValidationParameters = tokenValidationParameters
}; 

app.UseJwtBearerAuthentication(options); 
   ```

2.  This code in ClaimsController.cs sends the claims in the token back to the caller:
   ```
//We have one action method for returning the claims from the current token. 
public class ClaimsController : Controller 
{ 
    [Authorize] 
    [HttpGet] 
    public object Get() 
    { 
        return User.Claims.Select(x => 
            new  
            { 
                Type = x.Type, 
                Value = x.Value 
            } 
        ); 
    } 
} 
   ```
